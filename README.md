# pd2-muted-jump-and-crouch-casing-mode
My first Payday 2 mod.<br>
The same as [Dr_Newbie](https://github.com/DrNewbie "DrNewbie's Github Page")'s but mutes the "No suspicious actions allowed in casing mode." notification.<br>
Original: https://modworkshop.net/mod/21592

WARNING:<br>
Any mod that hooks onto the check jump and check duck methods in PlayerMaskOff should be incompatible.<br>
